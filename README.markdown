TranslateRoutes
===============

This Rails plugin provides a simple way to translate your URLs to any number of languages, even on a fully working application.  

It works fine with all kind of routing definitions, including RESTful and named routes.  
**Your code will remain untouched**: your current routing code, helpers and links will be translated transparently.  
(Un)installing it is a very clean and simple process, so why don't you give it a chance? ;)

Quick start
-----------

Let's start with a tiny example. Of course you need to define your routes first, e.g:

    ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map| 
      map.contact 'contact', :controller => 'contact', :action => 'index'
    end

1) Download the plugin to your app's `/vendor/plugins` directory.

2) Write your translations on a standard YAML file (e.g: i18n-routes.yml), including the locales and it translations pairs:

    es-ES:
      contact: contacto


3) Append a line to your routes.rb file to activate the translations. If you loaded the translations file with
your other I18n translations files, the line will be:

    ActionController::Routing::Translator.i18n('es-ES')
  
and if you want to keep the file separated (e.g: config/i18n-routes.yml), the line to append is:

	ActionController::Routing::Translator.translate_from_file('config','i18n-routes.yml')

You can see it working by executing `rake routes` on the shell:


    contact_es_es_path /es-ES/contacto {:locale=>"es-ES", :controller=>"contact", :action=>"index"}
    contact_en_us_path /contact        {:locale=>"en-US", :controller=>"contact", :action=>"index"}


As we can see, a new spanish route has been setted up and a `locale` parameter has been added to the routes.

4) Include this filter in your ApplicationController:

    before_filter :set_locale_from_url

Now your application recognizes the different routes and sets the `I18n.locale` value on your controllers, 
but what about the routes generation? As you can see on the previous `rake routes` execution, the 
`contact_es_es_path` and `contact_en_us_path` routing helpers have been generated and are 
available in your controllers and views. Additionally, a `contact_path` helper has been generated, which 
generates the routes according to the current I18n.locale value. 

This way **you don't need to modify your application links** because they **adapt automatically to the current locale**.

5) Hey, but what about my tests?

Of course, your functional and integration testing involves some requests. 
The plugin includes some code to add a default locale parameter so they can remain untouched.
Append it to your `test_helper` and it will be applied.

Handling of root route
----------------------

The root route ("unnamed" route) is handled differently depending on the "prefix_on_default_locale" configuration option.  If
prefix_on_default_locale==true, the root route is keep intact and all localized versions of this root route are added.

This is better explained with an example.  Given the following single route definition on config/routes.rb:

  map.root :controller => "home", :action => "index"

Without translate_routes the generated routes are:

  root  / {:controller=>"home", :action=>"index"}

With translate_routes and prefix_on_default_locale=false the routes are:

  root_es  /   {:action=>"index", :controller=>"home", :locale=>"es"}
  root_en  /en {:action=>"index", :controller=>"home", :locale=>"en"}

And finally with translate_routes and prefix_on_default_locale=true the routes are:

  root     /   {:action=>"index", :controller=>"home"}
  root_es  /es {:action=>"index", :controller=>"home", :locale=>"es"}
  root_en  /en {:action=>"index", :controller=>"home", :locale=>"en"}

It's important to note that in this last case the original root route does not get the "locale" param.  This allows controller
code to distinguish the "unlocalized root" path ("/") from the "localized root" path ("/es", "/en") and to redirect the user
to a suitable default locale from the unlocalized root.  The following example shows how to do it with the excellent 
http_accept_language plugin (http://github.com/iain/http_accept_language):

  def index
    available_locales = [ "es", "en"]
    unless params[ :locale]
      # if the locale is not specified in the URL we are in the unlocalized root path
      # we find the first available locale from the user agent's Accept-Language header
      request.user_preferred_languages.each do |locale|
        if available_locales.include?( locale)
          redirect_to :locale => locale   # we found one, redirect and finish
          return
        end
      end

      # no suitable locale found, redirect to the default one
      redirect_to :locale => I18n.default_locale
      return
    end

    # locale is set, handle the action as usual
    ...
  end
